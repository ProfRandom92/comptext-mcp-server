Title: [P] CompText MCP Server - Reduce LLM Token Usage by 90-95%

Hey r/MachineLearning!

I've been working on a solution to a problem many of us face: massive token consumption when working with LLMs. CompText MCS Server provides a domain-specific language approach that compresses common patterns.

**What it does:**
- Stores reusable command patterns in Notion
- Provides universal access via MCP Protocol & REST API
- Works with Claude, Perplexity, Cursor, ChatGPT, and more

**Real impact:**
Instead of sending 25,000 tokens of boilerplate, you send a 500-token reference. That's 95% reduction.

**Tech Stack:**
- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI for REST
- MCP SDK for native integration
- Notion as backend
- Docker-ready

Fully open source (MIT license), production-ready with CI/CD, tests, and comprehensive docs.

GitHub: https://github.com/ProfRandom92/comptext-mcp-server

Would love feedback from the community!

Title: Built an open-source MCP server for token-efficient LLM interactions

After hitting token limits repeatedly while building AI-powered dev tools, I created CompText MCP Server.

**Problem:** Repeatedly sending the same context/instructions to LLMs wastes tokens and money.

**Solution:** Store reusable patterns in a searchable codex, reference them by ID.

**Why MCP?** Model Context Protocol is the new standard for AI tool integration. Works natively with Claude, Cursor, and growing ecosystem.

**Why Notion?** Your team already uses it, and it's a great UI for managing command libraries.

Repo: https://github.com/ProfRandom92/comptext-mcp-server

Setup takes 5 minutes. Includes Docker, Railway deployment, CI/CD, the works.

MIT licensed, PRs welcome!

Title: CompText MCP Server - Token-efficient DSL for any LLM

For those running local models where context windows matter:

CompText MCP Server lets you store common prompts/patterns externally and reference them. Instead of:

"Here's my entire coding style guide... [25,000 tokens]"

You send:
"Use [Code-Style-Guide-v2]" [50 tokens]

Works with:
- Local models (LM Studio, Jan, Ollama)
- Cloud (Claude, GPT-4, Perplexity)
- IDEs (Cursor, VS Code)

Open source, easy Docker setup: https://github.com/ProfRandom92/comptext-mcp-server
